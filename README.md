# Double-Pendulum
Simulation of the double pendulum using RK4
This is a program that simulates the double pendulum based on different (random) initial positions.

Numpy and Matplotlib were used for matrix algebra and visualization.
The equations of motion were derived by hand using the Lagrangian Method and solved numerically using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method.

To see the magic, simply download the code and make sure all applicable libraries are installed and hit run.
